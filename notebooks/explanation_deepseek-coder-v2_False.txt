For the bipolar I disorder, we need to consider the following criteria from the ICD-11 CDDR:
1. Bipolar I Disorder - Mood Episode (Depressive, Manic, and Mixed) Criteria: 
   - At least one manic episode that does not meet the criteria for a Hypomanic episode.
   - OR at least one mixed episode.
   - OR at least two depressive episodes within a certain timeframe.
2. Bipolar II Disorder - Mood Episode (Depressive and Hypomanic) Criteria: 
   - At least one hypomanic episode.
   - AND at least one depressive episode within a certain timeframe.
3. Single Episode Depressive Disorder - Criteria for at least one depressive episode without any manic or mixed episodes.
4. Recurrent Depressive Disorder - Criteria for at least two depressive episodes, regardless of the presence of mania or hypomania.

For all these criteria, we need to check against symptoms recorded in the Observed relation and past conditions recorded in the History relation. We will use the `Observed` and `History` relations to determine if a patient meets the diagnostic criteria for each disorder. The relevant symptom names are "Depressive", "Mania", "Mixed", "Hypomanic", and "Depressive" (for Recurrent Depressive Disorder).

We will define rules that check these conditions based on the number of weeks symptoms were observed, which we'll assume is captured in the `Observed` relation. The relevant condition names for history are those specific to bipolar disorders: "Bipolar I", "Bipolar II", and for depressive episodes alone, terms like "Depressive Episode".
