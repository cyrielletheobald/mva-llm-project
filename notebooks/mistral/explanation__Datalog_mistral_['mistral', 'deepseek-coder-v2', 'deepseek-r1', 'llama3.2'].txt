To create the Datalog rules for diagnosing Bipolar I, Bipolar II, Single Episode Depressive Disorder, and Recurrent Depressive Disorder using pyDatalog, we'll follow these steps for each disorder:

1. Define the required terms and conditions:
   - Create terms for patients, weeks, observed symptoms, mood episodes, and disorders (Diagnosis).
   - Define any necessary helper functions if required.

2. Specify the criteria for Mood Episodes:
   - Depressive Episode
     - Minimum duration (e.g., at least 2 weeks)
     - Presence of five or more depressive symptoms (e.g., sadness, loss of interest, sleep disturbance, etc.)
   - Manic Episode
     - Minimum duration (e.g., at least 1 week)
     - Presence of seven or more manic symptoms (e.g., inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, increased goal-directed activity, etc.)
   - Hypomanic Episode
     - Minimum duration (e.g., at least 4 days)
     - Presence of four or more hypomanic symptoms (e.g., inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, increased goal-directed activity, etc.)
   - Mixed Episode
     - Simultaneous presence of depressive and manic symptoms

3. Specify the criteria for Mood Disorders:
   - Bipolar I
     - At least one Manic or Mixed Episode (with or without any Depressive Episodes)
   - Bipolar II
     - At least one Hypomanic Episode and at least one Depressive Episode
   - Single Episode Depressive Disorder
     - Depressive Episode with no history of Manic, Hypomanic, or Mixed Episodes
   - Recurrent Depressive Disorder
     - Two or more separate Depressive Episodes

4. Define the Diagnosis rules for each disorder based on their respective mood episode criteria.

5. Use the Observed and History relations to connect the symptoms, episodes, and disorders.
