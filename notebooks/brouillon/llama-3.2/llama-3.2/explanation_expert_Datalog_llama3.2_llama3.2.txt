The given code is missing several critical components and has a few syntax errors.

Firstly, the `create_terms` function should be used to define all terms that will be used in the Datalog program.
Secondly, the `sup` predicate needs to be defined as a separate rule or imported from another module if it's already defined elsewhere. In this case, we need to create it as a lambda function inside the program.

Additionally, the comparison operators should be replaced with their corresponding functions (`>=`, `<`, etc.) instead of using the `|` operator for logical OR.
Lastly, all rules and predicates need to be properly capitalized (e.g., `ManicEpisode(PATIENT)` instead of just `ManicEpisode(PATIENT)`).
