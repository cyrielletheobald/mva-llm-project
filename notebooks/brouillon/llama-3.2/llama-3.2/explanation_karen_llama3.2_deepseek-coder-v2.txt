We are dealing with the ICD-11 diagnostic criteria for Bipolar I, Bipolar II, Single Episode Depressive Disorder, and Recurrent Depressive Disorder.

**Step 1: Identify key components.**
- The disorder can be one of four conditions:
  - Bipolar I
  - Bipolar II
  - Single Episode Depressive Disorder
  - Recurrent Depressive Disorder

**Step 2: Mapping to kanren relations.**
- We map symptom observations using the `Observed(Patient, Symptom, Week)` relation.
- The diagnosis output is `Diagnosis(Patient, Disorder)`.
- We also have a History relation for past conditions.

**Step 3: Translating logic.**
- Mood Episode criterion:
  - The patient must have experienced a Depressive, Manic, Mixed, or Hypomanic Episode.
  - We will use separate conditions for each episode type.
- Mood Disorder criterion:
  - Count >= 1 of Bipolar I, Bipolar II, Single Episode Depressive Disorder, and Recurrent Depressive Disorder.
  - Since kanren does not natively support aggregation (COUNT), we will model this via repeated conjunctions for now (basic version).
- Relevant symptom names for Observed relation:
  - 'DepressedMood'
  - 'ManicHypomania'
  - 'MixedSymptoms'
  - 'HypomanicEpisode'
  - 'Anhedonia'
  - 'Fatigue'
  - 'SleepDisturbance'
  - 'AppetiteChange'
  - 'FeelingsOfWorthlessness'
  - 'DifficultyConcentrating'
  - 'SuicidalIdeation'
- Relevant condition names for History relation:
  - 'BipolarI'
  - 'BipolarII'
  - 'SingleEpisodeDepressiveDisorder'
  - 'RecurrentDepressiveDisorder'

**Step 4: Code structure.**
- We will declare the relations.
- We will define rule blocks for each disorder using kanren’s logic.
