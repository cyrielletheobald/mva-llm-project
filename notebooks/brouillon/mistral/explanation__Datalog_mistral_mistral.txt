I will provide the Datalog rules for each of the disorders based on the given criteria. Let's first define the relevant symptom and condition names:

```python
symptoms = ['Depression', 'Mania', 'Mixed', 'Hypomania']
conditions = ['Bipolar I', 'Bipolar II', 'Single Episode Depressive Disorder', 'Recurrent Depressive Disorder']
```

Now let's define the rules for Mood Episodes:

```python
# Depressive Episode
DepressiveEpisode(PATIENT) <= Observed(PATIENT, 'Depression', WEEKS) & (sup(WEEKS, 2.0))

# Manic Episode
ManicEpisode(PATIENT) <= Observed(PATIENT, 'Mania', WEEKS) & (sup(WEEKS, 1.0))

# Mixed Episode
MixedEpisode(PATIENT) <= Observed(PATIENT, 'Depression', WEEKS) & Observed(PATIENT, 'Mania', WEEKS) & (sup(WEEKS, 1.0))

# Hypomanic Episode
HypomanicEpisode(PATIENT) <= Observed(PATIENT, 'Hypomania', WEEKS) & (sup(WEEKS, 4.0))
```

Now let's define the rules for Mood Disorders:

```python
# Bipolar I
BipolarI(PATIENT) <= ManicEpisode(PATIENT) & History(PATIENT, 'Recurrent Depressive Disorder', Count)

# Bipolar II
BipolarII(PATIENT) <= DepressiveEpisode(PATIENT) & HypomanicEpisode(PATIENT) & History(PATIENT, 'Recurrent Depressive Disorder', Count)

# Single Episode Depressive Disorder
SingleDepressiveDisorder(PATIENT) <= DepressiveEpisode(PATIENT) & not History(PATIENT, 'Recurrent Depressive Disorder', Count)

# Recurrent Depressive Disorder
RecurrentDepressiveDisorder(PATIENT) <= (History(PATIENT, 'Recurrent Depressive Disorder', Count + 1) & not History(PATIENT, 'Single Episode Depressive Disorder', Count))
```
