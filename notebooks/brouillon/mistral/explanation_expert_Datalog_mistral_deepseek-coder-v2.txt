The provided code is mostly correct, but there are a few minor issues that need to be addressed. The main concerns are around the handling of comparisons and logical operations. In pyDatalog, direct comparisons like `sup(WEEKS, 3.0)` for floats should work fine, but it's always good to ensure everything is clear and correct. Additionally, the use of `Count=Count` in the RecurrentDepressiveDisorder rule is incorrect; this syntax doesn't correctly reference the predicate count. You should directly use the count value.
