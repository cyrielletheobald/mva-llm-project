The provided code has a minor issue with the comparison operator for floats. In pyDatalog and Python in general, you cannot directly compare float values using `>` or `<` operators within the constraint part of the rule. Instead, you should use a custom lambda function like `sup` to handle such comparisons. However, in this specific case, the provided code already uses a custom lambda function `sup`, but it seems there might be a misunderstanding about how to properly use the comparison operator for float values.

The correct way to compare float values is to ensure that you are using an appropriate comparison within your constraints. For example, if you want to check if `WEEKS` is greater than 3.0, you should directly include this condition in your constraint without wrapping it inside a lambda function or custom operator.
