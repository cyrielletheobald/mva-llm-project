The code provided defines the Observed relation for different types of mental health episodes but does not include any rules linking these observations to specific patients or checking if they meet the criteria for ManicEpisode. Additionally, there is a mistake in the logic for defining Observed relations where only WEEKS greater than 0.0 is checked without specifying whether this applies to all cases (which seems incorrect based on ICD-11 CDDR) and it lacks any reference to PATIENT. The corrected code below includes rules that define when a patient has a ManicEpisode, considering the weeks observed for each type of episode.
