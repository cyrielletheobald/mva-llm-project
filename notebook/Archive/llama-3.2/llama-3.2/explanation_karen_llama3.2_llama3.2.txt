We are dealing with the ICD-11 diagnostic criteria for Bipolar I, Bipolar II, Single Episode Depressive Disorder, and Recurrent Depressive Disorder.

**Step 1: Identify key components.**
- We have four disorders to consider:
  - 'BipolarI'
  - 'BipolarII'
  - 'SingleEpisodeDepressiveDisorder'
  - 'RecurrentDepressiveDisorder'

- Mood Episode criterion includes 'Manic', 'Mixed', and 'Hypomanic' episodes.
- We will translate ICD-11 CDDR criteria for these conditions.

**Step 2: Mapping to kanren relations.**
- We map symptom observations using the `Observed(Patient, Symptom, Week)` relation.
- The diagnosis output is `Diagnosis(Patient, Disorder)`.
- History relation includes relevant condition names.

**Step 3: Translating logic.**
- Mood Episode criteria:
  - We will encode each criterion as a separate rule block using kanren’s `conde()` operator for the OR condition.
- Mood Disorder criteria:
  - Count >= 1 of 'DepressedMood' or any other symptom.
  - Since kanren does not natively support aggregation (COUNT), we will model this via repeated conjunctions for now (basic version).

**Step 4: Code structure.**
- We will declare the relations.
- We will define a rule block for each disorder using kanren’s logic.
