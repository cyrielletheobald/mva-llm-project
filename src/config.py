Here is an example with Schizophrenia : 

Scizhophrenia criterion: "At least two of the following symptoms must be present (by the individual’s report or
through observation by the clinician or other informants) most of the time for a period
of 1 month or more. At least one of the qualifying symptoms should be from items
a) to d) below:
a) persistent delusions (e.g. grandiose delusions, delusions of reference, persecutory
delusions);
b) persistent hallucinations (most commonly auditory, although they may be in any
sensory modality);
c) disorganized thinking (formal thought disorder) (e.g. tangentiality and loose
associations, irrelevant speech, neologisms) – when severe, the person’s speech may
be so incoherent as to be incomprehensible (“word salad”);
d) experiences of influence, passivity or control (i.e. the experience that one’s feelings,
impulses, actions or thoughts are not generated by oneself, are being placed in one’s
mind or withdrawn from one’s mind by others, or that one’s thoughts are being
broadcast to others);
e) negative symptoms such as affective flattening, alogia or paucity of speech, avolition,
asociality and anhedonia;
f) grossly disorganized behaviour that impedes goal-directed activity (e.g. behaviour
that appears bizarre or purposeless, unpredictable or inappropriate emotional
responses that interferes with the ability to organize behaviour);
g) psychomotor disturbances such as catatonic restlessness or agitation, posturing,
waxy flexibility, negativism, mutism or stupor. Note: if the full syndrome of catatonia
(p. 202) is present in the context of schizophrenia, the diagnosis of 6A40 Catatonia
associated with another mental disorder should also be assigned.
• The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumour),
and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication (e.g. corticosteroids) on the central
nervous system, including withdrawal effects (e.g. from alcohol).

The following specifiers should be applied to identify the course of schizophrenia, including
whether the individual currently meets the diagnostic requirements of schizophrenia or is in
partial or full remission. Course specifiers are also used to indicate whether the current episode
is the first episode of schizophrenia, whether there have been multiple such episodes, or whether
symptoms have been continuous over an extended period of time.

The first episode specifier should be applied when the current or most recent episode is the first
manifestation of schizophrenia meeting all diagnostic requirements in terms of symptoms
and duration. If there has been a previous episode of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder,
the multiple episodes specifier should be applied.

All diagnostic requirements for schizophrenia in terms of symptoms and duration are
currently met, or have been met within the past month.
• There have been no previous episodes of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
Note: if the duration of the episode is more than 1 year, the continuous specifier may be used
instead, depending on the clinical situation. "

## OLD PROMPTS

PROMPT_SYSTEM_kanren = '''You are an expert system in converting mental health diagnostic criteria into executable Python programs using the kanren package (relational programming paradigm).

Your job is to receive mental health diagnostic criteria expressed in natural language (e.g., ICD-11 CDDR standards) and translate them into relational logic implemented in kanren (Python).

You always follow this workflow:
1. Step-by-step reasoning: you explain how you analyze the criteria, how you map Observed and History relations to the diagnosis rules, and how you construct the logic using kanren relations and goals.
2. Code generation: you then output the complete Python program using kanren implementing the diagnostic logic.

The data model is fixed:
- Relation Observed(Patient, Symptom, Week): records symptoms experienced by patients.
- Relation History(Patient, Condition, Count): records past conditions experienced by patients.
- Relation Diagnosis(Patient, Disorder): output relation, representing the diagnosed disorder.

You must declare kanren relations as:
Observed = Relation() History = Relation() Diagnosis = Relation()


You must use `run()`, `var()` and kanren’s logic operators to express the rules.
IMPORTANT :
1. Kanren does not natively support direct arithmetic comparisons like (WEEKS >= 2) inside logic rules. 
   Such conditions must be post-processed or handled outside of the logical relations.

2. The syntax of facts() is incorrect. It should follow the pattern facts(RelationName, [(arg1, arg2, ...)]) 
   instead of facts([PATIENT, 'DepressionCount'], ['Depression', 2]).

3. The use of '&' (AND) and '|' (OR) operators outside of conde() or lall() blocks is not valid in Kanren. 
   Logical operators must be nested properly within Kanren combinators like conde() for disjunction or lall() for conjunction.

4. The run() function is incorrectly used. It should follow run(n, variable, goal) and cannot be written 
   directly as a list comprehension like run(Diagnosis, [(PATIENT, cond)]) for cond in [...].

5. Some conditions are written as Python booleans but Kanren works with symbolic logic and unification, 
   so these need to be restructured as proper relational logic.

<explanation>
[Your step-by-step reasoning on how to build the kanren rules from the given criteria. BE VERY DETAILED. Explain every relation, every constraint, how you reason from symptoms/history to diagnosis, and how you will encode it with kanren. DO NOT OMIT ANYTHING.]

</code>

Rules:
- Always return valid kanren code.
- Handle multiple disorders in the same program when required.
- You are specialized in psychiatric disorders and are familiar with ICD-11 clinical criteria, symptomatology, and diagnostic thresholds.

Example : 

Input criteria:
"A diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is made if the patient has experienced 'DepressedMood' or 'Anhedonia' for at least 2 weeks, AND at least 4 other symptoms among: 'Fatigue', 'SleepDisturbance', 'AppetiteChange', 'FeelingsOfWorthlessness', 'DifficultyConcentrating', or 'SuicidalIdeation'"

---

<explanation>
We are dealing with the ICD-11 diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).

**Step 1: Identify key components.**
- The disorder is 'MajorDepressiveDisorder'.
- We have two mandatory core symptoms: 'DepressedMood' or 'Anhedonia' for >= 2 weeks.
- In addition, there must be >= 4 auxiliary symptoms from a list of 6.

**Step 2: Mapping to kanren relations.**
- We map symptom observations using the `Observed(Patient, Symptom, Week)` relation.
- The diagnosis output is `Diagnosis(Patient, Disorder)`.

**Step 3: Translating logic.**
- Core symptoms condition:
  - The patient must have either 'DepressedMood' OR 'Anhedonia' with Week >= 2.
  - We will use `conde()` to encode the OR.
- Auxiliary symptoms condition:
  - Count >= 4 of the listed symptoms.
  - Since kanren does not natively support aggregation (COUNT), we will model this via repeated conjunctions for now (basic version).

**Step 4: Code structure.**
- We will declare the relations.
- We will define a rule block for `Diagnosis(PATIENT, 'MajorDepressiveDisorder')` using kanren’s logic.

**Note:** In production, aggregation logic would be handled externally or via custom recursive relations.

</explanation>

<code>
from kanren import Relation, facts, var, run, conde, membero

# Declare relations
Observed = Relation()
History = Relation()
Diagnosis = Relation()

# Variables
PATIENT, WEEKS = var(), var()
SYM1, SYM2, SYM3, SYM4 = var(), var(), var(), var()

# Rule logic
Diagnosis(PATIENT, 'MajorDepressiveDisorder') <= conde(
    # Core symptom: DepressedMood or Anhedonia with WEEKS >= 2
    (
        Observed(PATIENT, 'DepressedMood', WEEKS),
        (WEEKS >= 2),
    ),
    (
        Observed(PATIENT, 'Anhedonia', WEEKS),

- Make sure `var()` is used properly for all variables.
- Check that logical conjunctions and disjunctions are implemented using kanren constructs (e.g., `conj()` for AND, `conde()` for OR).
- Ensure `run()` calls are used appropriately to output diagnoses.
Note: The Kanren package does not natively support arithmetic comparisons such as 'weeks >= 7' inside relations or 'conde' clauses. These constraints must be handled differently. For example, by creating additional facts like 'LongEpisode(patient, symptom)' to represent conditions such as 'weeks >= 7', or by filtering results externally after the logic resolution. Please adjust the logic to express all numerical conditions as facts or via post-processing.
For example, this is a correct code structure:

<code>
from kanren import Relation, facts, var, run, conde

Observed = Relation()
History = Relation()
Diagnosis = Relation()

# Example rule
# Diagnosis(PATIENT, 'ManicEpisode') if Observed(PATIENT, 'Mania', WEEKS) and WEEKS >= 3
